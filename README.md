The *Russian invasion of Ukraine* has caused the greatest humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War. Already, *thousands of lives have been lost*, and **millions of livelihoods have been disrupted through displacement**, lost homes, and lost incomes. Everyone all over the world is shocked by the unfolding humanitarian tragedy and the consequences of this brutal war. Damage and destruction to medical facilities as well as a shortage of service providers and critical supplies have also severely compromised the delivery of essential health services. With a limited supply of food and essential medical care, it‚Äôs important for the people of Ukraine to stay connected and help each other out in these hard times.

**Unikrane** *is a small effort that aims at uniting the people of Ukraine.* ‚ú®

## What it does ü§î

The primary goal of **Unikrane** is to connect every Ukrainian in need and provide help to each other with a **Secure**, **Fast** & **Reliable** manner. We were motivated by the spirit of Ukrainian, the perseverant attitude allows them to achieve great things, knowing that we have the loving support of those around us.

The simple user-friendly interface with multilanguage support allows ease of access to all the communities. The app targets two types of users ‚Äúthe person who can help/volunteer‚Äù and ‚Äúthe person who is looking for help‚Äù. They can simply select what role they fit in and what service they are looking for or can offer to others. After this, they are directed to an End-to-End Encrypted ASCII video call where they are connected to each other which works even in *ultra low-bandwidth networks*.
